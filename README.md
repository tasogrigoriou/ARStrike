# ARStrike

ARStrike is an Augmented Reality first-person shooting game inspired by the Rick and Morty TV series. 

This is the final project made for San Francisco State University course CSC 690 Interactive Multimedia Application Development, Fall 2018.

## Gameplay

1. Place a portal in real-world space using ARKit tracking detection by moving your device around until you feel satistifed with its translation in the world.
2. Player is then spawned with Rick's Ray Gun in first-person perspective.
3. Level one is loaded and enemies spawn out of portal with random movement.
4. Once all enemies are defeated, the player moves to the next level where enemies are spawned and objective becomes more difficult.
5. Every 3rd level (Level 3, Level 6, etc) there is a boss (Pickle Rick, Cornvelious, Senhor Poopy, etc) that you must defeat to move forward.
